# Lucas Galdino
Hello there! My name is Lucas. I'm a Canadian student of biomedical sciences with a keen interest in computational and cognitive neuroscience. I am fascinated by the effect of practice and habit on our mind. Some other areas of interest to me are phylosophy, religion, coding, and business. I also play the piano and the guitar, because music is math you can listen to.

* Lucas Galdino
Hello there! I'm Lucas Galdino. I'm a Canadian student of biomedical sciences, planning on pursuing a master's in computational and cognitive neuroscience. 

My main area of interest is the effect of keeping different practices and habits on our cognition, and how we can cultivate an [[https://awakentomeaning.com/starting-practice/][ecology of practices]] to nurture our sense of purpose and fulfilment. My goal is to do research in that area and share it with as many people as possible.

Some other interests to mine are philosophy, religion, coding, and business. I also sing and play piano and guitar.

* Lucas Galdino
Hello there! My name is Lucas. I'm a Canadian student of biomedical sciences planning on pursuing a master's in computational and cognitive neuroscience. I am fascinated by the effect that keeping different practices or habits can have on our mind, and my goal is to do research in that area and share it with others. 

Some other interests to mine are phylosophy, religion, coding, and business. I also sing and play piano and guitar.

*My works, articles and videos on health and phylosophy
